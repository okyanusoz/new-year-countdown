# New Year Countdown

This is a simple new year countdown(currently 2021).

<h3>Running it locally</h3>

You need Node.js(at least 12 is recommended.)

First, edit src/Config.js if would you like to change the configuration.

Then run:
        npm install
        npm start

The app will now be listening on http://localhost:3000.

To build, run(after running npm install):
        npm run build

The built app will be in the build directory.

<h3>Contributing</h3>

To contribute, just send a pull request.
The tests will run, and if they succeed, then I will be happy to merge your PR.
