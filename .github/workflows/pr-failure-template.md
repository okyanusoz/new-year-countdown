Hello,

We weren't able to build the project with your work successfully.

To see what's wrong, you can look at the CI logs which you can find below.

Make sure you don't have any typos in the code and you're not repeating yourself.

Once you push another commit, Github Actions will automatically try the build the project.

Happy coding!
