Hello,

This is a built (ready-to-deploy) version of new-year-countdown. The source code is not uploaded to Vercel and built on Vercel servers.

Instead, we use GitHub Actions to build the app. Because of that, you can also download this built site from https://github.com/okyanusoz/new-year-countdown/actions/workflows/deploy.yml . GitHub Actions artifact downloads are intended for most users.

There are no diffrencies between the build directory here and the build artifact generated using GitHub Actions. You can still use this explorer to explore the built code, though.
